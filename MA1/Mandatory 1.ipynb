        "Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. The template below can be used to submit your answers for the mandatory assignment. Within the template you find all typical issues. By default, code is omitted in the output (can be changed with `echo: true` in line 6). Formatting is done using markdown (e.g., check out how to use \\# to define sections and subsections or how to generate bold text). Footnotes and citations are easy. You can also include math notation using LaTeX style. The template contains inline code execution (e.g. to automatically return the ticker of the asset with the highest Sharpe ratio) and shows how to embed figures into the document.\n",
